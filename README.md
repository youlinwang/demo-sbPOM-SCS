# demo-sbPOM-SCS
In this tutorial, I will show how to adapt the sbPOM's source code into a South China Sea model.

I'll use the East Coast example code, downloaded from sbPOM's official website. For model details, please refer to “Jordi, A., & Wang, D. P. (2012). sbPOM: A parallel implementation of Princenton Ocean Model. Environmental Modelling & Software, 38, 59-61.”.
